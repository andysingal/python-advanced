Installation
```
If don’t want to install Polars with python -m pip install "polars[all]", then you’ll need to at least run python -m pip install "polars[numpy, pandas]" at this point.
```
To create the Polars DataFrame, you call pl.DataFrame(). The class constructor for a Polars DataFrame accepts two-dimensional data in various forms, a dictionary in this example. You now have a Polars DataFrame that’s ready to use!

When you display buildings in the console, a nice string representation of the DataFrame is displayed. The string representation first prints the shape of the data as a tuple with the first entry telling you the number of rows and the

second the number of columns in the DataFrame.

you call buildings.describe() to get summary statistics for each column in the DataFrame. This is one of the best ways to get a quick feel for the nature of the dataset that you’re working with. Here’s what each row returned from .describe() means:

```
buildings = pl.DataFrame(buildings_data)
buildings.describe()

```

- count is the number of observations or rows in the dataset.
- null_count is the number of missing values in the column.
- mean is the arithmetic mean, or average, of the column.
- std is the standard deviation of the column.
- min is the minimum value of the column.
- max is the maximum value of the column.
- median is the median value, or fiftieth percentile, of the column.
- 25% is the twenty-fifth percentile, or first quartile, of the column.
- 75% is the seventy-fifth percentile, or third quartile, of the column.

```
buildings.select(pl.col("sqft"))
```
One context that you’ll often use prior to .select() is .filter(). As the name suggests, .filter() reduces the size of the data based on a given expression. For example, if you want to filter the data down to houses that were built after 2015,
you could run the following:
```
after_2015 = buildings.filter(pl.col("year") > 2015)
```
## The Lazy API
Polars’ lazy API is one of the most powerful features of the library. With the lazy API, you can specify a sequence of operations without immediately running them. Instead, these operations are saved as a computational graph and only run
when necessary. This allows Polars to optimize queries before execution, catch schema errors before the data is processed, and perform memory-efficient queries on datasets that don’t fit into memory.
